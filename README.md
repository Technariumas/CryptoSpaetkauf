It's a smart contract service providing a means for people to share their liquor stash after hours. The principle is simple:
one person announces somewhere (let's say, on Reddit/IRC/darknet forum..) that they have a certain bottle for a certain price. The buyer commits to taking the bottle and bringing an identical bottle tomorrow. If they fail to bring back the bottle, the contract transfers twice the initial cost from escrow to the bottle's owner.
